# Almost There
Almost There is a top down, twin stick zombie shooter where the player must work with other survivors to make it to the safe haven. Travel by day is safest where by night, zombies are more aggressive and staying the night in a nearby abandoned home is encouraged. If all goes well you won't have to spend the night defending the home you have chosen to find temporary sanctuary in. 
#### Purpose
The purpose of this game was to expand upon Unity3D's Roguelike tutorial for level generation into a generation of entire playing field which would include multiple homes (dungeons) and an overall path that leads to a safe haven at the end. 
#### Game State
Work In Progress
#### Status
On hold due to my insatiable curiosity of game development.
#### Progress
Can Generate rooms  and hallways similarly to the tutorial, however its accomplishing it through a 3 dimensional jagged array as opposed to a two dimensional as used in the tutorial. The third dimension is tracking layer of tile. Assets are also being instantiated in place of the tile data.

#### Remarks
My interest in level generation is what led me to Unity3D's Roguelike tutorial and looking at it, I saw it as an opportunity to learn more about it by expanding the tutorial into generation of more than just roguelike dungeons. In scrolling through the abundance of free assets contributors provide, this idea was born. This may be on hold as I pursue other interests, but it is not forgotten.
